# Project 4: Orbital Paths via Differential Equations

## Overview

This project utilizes Python to model and visualize the orbital paths of celestial bodies using differential equations. Specifically, we solve the equations governing the Earth's orbit around the Sun and visualize these paths through various methods, including animations. The project is executed within the Vocareum platform but can be adapted for local environments.


## Functions to Implement

- **`orbital_eqs(e_0, t_0)`**: Calculates the velocity and acceleration of the Earth at a given time.
- **`solve_orbital_eqs(time_steps, speed)`**: Solves the orbital equations using initial conditions and time steps.

- **`extend_limits(limits, pad)`**: Adjusts the plotting limits for animations to ensure the Earth remains within view.
- **`animate_earth_orbit(orbit, title)`**: Creates an animated plot of Earth's orbit around the Sun.
